## R Markdown[^1]

[^1]: This document uses the following R packages: [@base; @knitr; @dplyr].

This is an R Markdown document [@xie2016]. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Manual Table

| Parameter | Value | Confidence Interval |
|-----------|-------|---------------------|
| govact    | 1.56  | [0.45, 3.02]        |
|           |       |                     |
|           |       |                     |

: A manually added table.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
